## What is that ?
<p>Modules, is <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> with a content manager layer above.</p>
<p>I developed this CMS for my personal use (for now in French), to have a tool whose backoffice, the simplest possible, is intended only for the end user to manage its contents.<br>
HTML structure, styles, javascript and possibly additional php classes are worked separately in the theme folder files.</p>
